## What is it?

This is Twilio Flex wrapped into Electron. 

## Benefits? 

  1. You are under control and can allow any CRMs to be loaded within Flex.
  2. It is safer as you won't have the risk of having bad actors like a malicious Chrome Extension.

## Hot to run it locally:

  - use node v20
  - `npm install`
  - `npm start`

## How to compile an executable:

  - use node v20
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run package`
  - `npm run make`
  - go to folder `/out` and execute it.
